The code can be run from a terminal and will produce graphs and text based results for the purpose of comparison
The code is also well annotated so anyone can change whichever variables they wish. The code will then have to
be rerun to produce the results wanted.
The report shows what the code is meant to produce. Note that arbitrary choice of variables does not guarantee 
expected results. Changing the universal gravitational constant or the initial velocity does not guarantee an
elliptic orbit.
